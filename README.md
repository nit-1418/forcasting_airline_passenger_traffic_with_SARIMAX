# Forecasting Airline Passenger Traffic with SARIMAX

## Overview
This project focuses on estimating the number of airline passengers in future years by analyzing historical passenger data. Using the SARIMAX model, we capture both seasonal patterns and the impact of external factors to create accurate forecasts.

## Dataset
The primary dataset includes monthly airline passenger counts from 1949 to 1960:
- **Month**: The date of each observation.
- **Passengers**: The number of passengers per month.

An additional dataset, `promotion.csv`, is used as an exogenous variable to incorporate the influence of promotions or other external factors on passenger numbers.

## Features
- Time series analysis of historical passenger data.
- Integration of external variables for enhanced forecasting.
- Implementation of the SARIMAX model to capture seasonal trends and external influences.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/forecasting_airline_passenger_traffic_with_SARIMAX.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   
3. Run the analysis and forecasting script:
   ```bash
   python forcasting_airline_passenger_traffic_with_SARIMAX.ipynb
   ```

## Results
The model provides forecasts of monthly airline passenger traffic, highlighting trends and the effects of external variables such as promotions.
